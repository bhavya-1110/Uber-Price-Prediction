<h2 align="center"> UBER PRICE PREDICTION </h2>
This project aims to predict the price of an Uber ride based on several factors like distance, time of day, location, weather, and other relevant factors. By predicting the price of a ride, passengers can plan their trips better, and drivers can determine the most profitable time to drive.

<h5> DATA </h5>
The data used for this project is obtained from Uber's API, which provides access to anonymized trip data. The data includes information such as pick-up and drop-off locations, distance, time of day, and the fare amount. Additionally, external data such as weather data, traffic data, and other relevant data can also be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions.

<h5> METHODOLOGY </h5>
The project will use machine learning algorithms to predict the price of a ride. The data will be preprocessed to handle missing values, categorical data, and outliers. Exploratory data analysis will be performed to understand the data's distribution and correlation. The model's performance will be evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).

<h5> TOOLS </h5>
The project will be implemented using Python programming language, and several libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-learn will be used for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. The project's code will be stored in a GitHub repository, making it easy to share, collaborate, and maintain.

<h5> CONCLUSION </h5>
The project's goal is to provide a useful tool for both passengers and drivers to estimate the price of an Uber ride accurately. With accurate price predictions, passengers can make informed decisions about their travel plans, and drivers can optimize their earnings by choosing the best times to drive.
